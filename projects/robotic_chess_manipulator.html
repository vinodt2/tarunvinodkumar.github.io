                    This project developed a robotic system capable of grasping and placing chess pieces
                    on a board with accurate positioning. The system combines a 3D-printer gantry, a
                    custom rack-and-pinion grasper, and closed-loop sensing to pick up a specified piece,
                    move it to a new square, and place it reliably within the 3.5 cm by 3.5 cm bounds of
                    each tile.
                  </p>

                  <div class="project-section-title">Motivation &amp; Aim</div>
                  <p>
                    The goal was to design a generalizable small-object manipulation platform, instantiated
                    as a robotic chess manipulator. A user enters the source and destination squares; the
                    robot moves to the correct position, grasps the piece, translates across the board,
                    and places the piece at the new location.
                  </p>

                  <div class="project-section-title">Performance Metrics</div>
                  <ul class="proj-list">
                    <li>Pick and place within the 3.5 cm &times; 3.5 cm target square bounds.</li>
                    <li>Accurate sensing of when the piece contacts the board to control z-motion.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <div class="project-section-title">Mechanical &amp; Mechatronic Design</div>
                  <p>
                    The custom grasper uses a rack-and-pinion mechanism driven by a 28BYJ stepper motor.
                    The design integrates a rod-bearing interface and opposed paddles to provide a secure,
                    symmetric grasp on standard chess pieces while remaining compact and lightweight.
                  </p>

                  <div class="project-section-title">Sensors &amp; Actuators</div>
                  <p><strong>Actuators.</strong> A 28BYJ stepper motor provides the gripping motion, chosen for
                    its 3.4 N·cm holding torque, low current draw, and small form factor, which satisfied
                    the torque and packaging requirements of the grasper.</p>
                  <p><strong>Sensors.</strong> A Hall-effect sensor detects proximity of the piece to the board,
                    triggering the release and ensuring consistent placement even for pieces of varying height.
                    The sensor's small footprint and sufficient sensitivity allowed simple circuitry and robust
                    operation across multiple piece geometries.</p>

                  <div class="project-section-title">Control &amp; State Machine</div>
                  <p>
                    The system is orchestrated by an STM microcontroller communicating with a host computer
                    and the 3D-printer gantry. A state machine coordinates motion and grasping: moving to the
                    source square, closing the grasper, lifting, translating to the destination square, sensing
                    board proximity via the Hall-effect sensor, and opening the grasper to release the piece.
                  </p>

                  <div class="project-section-title">Challenges &amp; Iteration</div>
                  <ul class="proj-list">
                    <li>Initial motor driver and stepper choice produced jittery, partial-step motion, leading
                        the team to pivot back to lab-standard steppers.</li>
                    <li>An early FSR-based grasp-force sensor proved unreliable and alignment-sensitive, so it
                        was replaced with the more robust Hall-effect sensing scheme.</li>
                    <li>Coordinating communication among the STM, laptop, and 3D-printer controller required
                        careful handling of UART/serial links and debugging tools.</li>
                    <li>Multiple design iterations were needed to tune 3D-printed tolerances and scale the
                        original grasper concept to fit the gantry hardware.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <div class="project-section-title">Outcomes &amp; Next Steps</div>
                  <p>
                    The final system successfully performed repeated grasping, placing, and positioning of
                    chess pieces after extensive iteration. Key technical takeaways included STM-Python
                    communication over UART, step-by-step debugging using LEDs and serial terminals, and
                    the importance of wire management in physical prototypes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Future work would expand the instrumented board to support arbitrary placement squares by
                    multiplying the Hall-effect sensing scheme, and further optimize the grasper by adding
                    textured contact surfaces and a dedicated feedback loop for grasp quality.
