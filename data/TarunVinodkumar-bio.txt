Tarun Vinodkumar is completing his bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Tech, where he works with Professor Jun Ueda in the Biorobotics and Human Modeling Lab. His research centers around improving current medical technology and developing emerging tools for minimally invasive surgery, including work on Magnetic Resonance Elastography actuator validation and an imaging‑integrated laparoscopic forceps design. Through this work he has published in the ASME Journal of Medical Devices, presented at multiple conferences, and established a research focus on intelligent surgical instrumentation with advanced intraoperative sensing systems.
In parallel, internships at Medtronic on the HUGO robotic surgery system exposed to him realities of reliability, manufacturability, and clinical translation, shaping how he frames research problems. In student leadership roles at Georgia Tech, he has also mentored many students entering the medical devices field. Ultimately, Tarun hopes to advance surgical robotics through both technical innovation and cultivating engineers who approach medical technology with empathy for patients and their families.
