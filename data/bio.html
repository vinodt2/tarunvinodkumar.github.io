        <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p>
          Tarun Vinodkumar is completing his bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering at
          Georgia Tech, where he works with Professor Jun Ueda in the Biorobotics and
          Human Modeling Lab. His research focuses on improving current medical technology
          and developing emerging tools for minimally invasive surgery, including work on
          Magnetic Resonance Elastography actuator validation and an imaging-integrated
          laparoscopic forceps design.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through this work he has published in the ASME Journal of Medical Devices,
          presented at multiple conferences, and established a research focus on intelligent
          surgical instrumentation with advanced intraoperative sensing systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          In parallel, internships at Medtronic on the HUGO robotic surgery system exposed
          him to the realities of reliability, manufacturability, and clinical translation,
          shaping how he frames research problems. In student leadership roles at Georgia Tech,
          he has also mentored many students entering the medical devices field. Ultimately,
          Tarun hopes to advance surgical robotics through both technical innovation and
          cultivating engineers who approach medical technology with empathy for patients and
          their families.
